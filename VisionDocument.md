User Description

2.1 User/Market Demographics
Our target audience will be young people (ages 18-26). They will primarily be college students, being that a lot of our advertising events will take place on college campuses. Our location target will be areas that have a high population of young people (e.g.: College towns, big cities).

2.2 User Personas
(in the works)

2.3 User Environment
Aye users will be able to communicate with each other by one user sending the message “Aye” to another single user or a predetermined group of users.
The sending of the message can be completed in minimal time simply by tapping on a group or users tag at which point the app will automatically send “Aye” to any person associated with that tag.
The Aye app will be able to operate immediately only if the user has an internet connection. If the user has no signal then the message will be queued in the app until a signal is obtained at which point the app will send the message.
The app will be able to be installed on smartphones along with having a web based version with a complete API for all interface controls to allow for easy integration into future platforms.
